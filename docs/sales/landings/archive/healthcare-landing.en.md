- Continuous reporting for DPO and internal audit

</div>

## 3. Resilient Operations

<div class="tactical-container tactical-container--compact" markdown="1">

- Micro-CPDs and edge AI reduce latency and cloud dependency
- Compliance automation (AI Act / NIS2) with reproducible evidence
- Modular scaling by clinical service: lab, pharmacy, bed management

</div>

## 4. Next Steps

<div class="tactical-container tactical-container--compact" markdown="1">

1. Validate with DPO and medical direction the clinical case
2. Execute "Hospital Assisted AI" pilot with compliance evidence factory
3. Scale to other hospitals or clinical services after regulatory validation
