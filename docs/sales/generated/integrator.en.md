## 1. Structural Problem

<div class="tactical-container tactical-container--compact" markdown="1">

- Technological multipolarity and hyperscaler dependency
- Regulations (AI Act, NIS2, CRA, GDPR) without homogeneous material capacity
- Operational risk, loss of control, and insufficient talent

</div>

## 2. ATLANTYQA Proposal

<div class="feature-card feature-card--accent-left-green" markdown="1">

Compliance Evidence Pack + Sovereign Agents replicable across partners, with workflows that generate reproducible artifacts and metric dashboards.
