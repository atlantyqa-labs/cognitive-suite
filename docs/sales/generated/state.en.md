# Spanish State / Autonomous Communities · ATLANTYQA One-Pager

<span class="sovereignty-badge">Sales Asset · State & Regional Government</span>

> *Institutional elevator pitch (30s)*
> "The State and Autonomous Communities need to digitize without losing data sovereignty or financing external infrastructure. ATLANTYQA deploys local sovereign nodes, audited automation, and talent squads that execute public policies with full traceability and control."

## 1. Structural Problem

<div class="tactical-container tactical-container--compact" markdown="1">

- Technological multipolarity and hyperscaler dependency
- Regulations (AI Act, NIS2, CRA, GDPR) without homogeneous material capacity
- Operational risk, loss of control, and insufficient talent

</div>

## 2. ATLANTYQA Proposal

<div class="feature-card feature-card--accent-left-green" markdown="1">

Municipal Sovereignty Starter: micro-CPD + local AI + citizen portal + replicable evidence stack with run-local-workflow scripts, docker-compose, and operations playbooks.
