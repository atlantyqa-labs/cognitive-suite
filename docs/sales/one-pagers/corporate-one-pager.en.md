> *Institutional elevator pitch (30s)*
> "Banks, insurers, utilities, and hospitals need to automate with AI without losing control or opening regulatory fronts. ATLANTYQA provides sovereign agents, compliance evidence pipelines, and squads that operate with built-in audit and legal knowledge."

---

## 1. Structural Problem

<div class="tactical-container tactical-container--compact" markdown="1">

- Ungoverned automations increase reputational and legal risk
- Regulatory pressure (AI Act, NIS2, GDPR) demands traceability and continuous evidence
- Technology alone isn't enough — clear policies and auditable logging are required

</div>

## 2. ATLANTYQA Proposal

<div class="feature-card feature-card--accent-left-green" markdown="1">

Agentic Ops Pack: document and service agents running on-premise or in secure micro-CPDs, with compliance-as-code and real-time reporting.

</div>

</div>

## 4. Success Metrics

<div class="tactical-container tactical-container--compact" markdown="1">

- Reduced cycle time for approvals and audits
- Reduction in sensitive data incidents
- XP/badges dashboards for squads and reviewers

</div>

## 5. Core Argument

<div class="mantra-manifesto" markdown="1">
"We automate without giving up control or compliance: every agent call is audited, every flow is versioned, and every decision can be explained to a regulator."
</div>

## 6. Recommended Next Step

<div class="tactical-container tactical-container--compact" markdown="1">

- Pilot "Agentic Ops Pack" in a regulated domain (legal, financial)
- Validation with the agent governance framework (detailed documentation shared through private channels)
- Modular pricing (license + operations + squads) with risk/reputation offices

</div>
