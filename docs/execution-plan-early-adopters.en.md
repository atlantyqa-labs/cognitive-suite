# Execution Plan for Early Adopters

This plan complements the [Adoption Plan](adoption-plan.md) and details the
specific activities required to coordinate early adopter participation on
GitHub. It includes a suggested timeline, issue creation, project organization,
and feedback mechanisms.

## 📅 Suggested timeline

### Week 1 – Kickoff and environment

1. **Kickoff meeting**: brief introductions and explanation of program goals.
2. **Environment setup**: ensure all participants can clone the repository,
   install dependencies, and run the basic ingest/analysis flow.
3. **Initial issue creation**: open one issue per fundamental task (e.g.,
   “Ingest first PDF document”, “Run analysis pipeline with spaCy”). Label
   each issue with `onboarding` and assign volunteer owners.
4. **Project board**: configure a GitHub Kanban Project with columns “To do”,
   “In progress”, and “Done”, add the relevant issues, and explain how to move
   cards.

### Week 2 – Semantic analysis and feedback

1. **NLP tutorial**: publish a short tutorial on spaCy and transformers.
2. **Hands-on activity**: each adopter runs `pipeline/analyze.py` on their own
   files and shares results in the related issue.
3. **Initial feedback**: collect comments on installation, documentation, and
   usability; document improvements as new issues.

### Week 3 – Vector search and UI exploration

1. **Vector store presentation**: explain FAISS and Qdrant. Compare basic
   performance.
2. **Exercise**: index the embeddings generated in the previous session and
   run similarity queries.
3. **Explore the frontend**: each participant runs the Streamlit UI and
   explores analyses; open an issue for UI improvement suggestions.

### Week 4 – Integrations and extensions

1. **Open Notebook integration**: guide to run the wrapper and send a document
   to Open Notebook. Compare results with the suite.
2. **RAG extension**: discuss integrating LangChain or Haystack based on the
   recommendations document.
3. **Public demo**: prepare a small demo to show results to stakeholders and
   collect final feedback.

## 🗂️ Issue and project organization

1. **Naming and labels**: use descriptive issue names (“Exercise: Semantic
   Analysis – Week 2”), and label with `early-adopter`, `tutorial`, or
   `feedback` as appropriate.
2. **Task assignment**: encourage participants to self-assign issues. A
   facilitator can reassign or split tasks if blockers appear.
3. **Project tracking**: update the board regularly, move cards by status, and
   add brief notes if problems or insights emerge.

## 💬 Communication channels

- **GitHub Discussions**: create a general thread for questions and support.
  Encourage questions there so they remain documented.
- **Regular meetings**: run weekly meetings (video) to review progress, clear
  blockers, and align expectations.
- **Satisfaction surveys**: at the end of each phase, run a short survey to
  measure experience and collect suggestions.

## 🔄 Feedback management and improvements

1. **Collection**: at the end of each week, gather all comments from issues,
   discussions, and meetings.
2. **Classification**: group feedback by category (usability, performance,
   documentation, new features).
3. **Prioritization**: create prioritized improvement issues based on impact
   and ease of implementation. Label clearly as `enhancement` or `bug`.
4. **Implementation**: plan improvements in later cycles, allowing early
   adopters to contribute via pull requests.

## ✅ Program close

At the end of four weeks, organize a final session to review achievements and
thank early adopters for their participation. Document lessons learned and
update the adoption guide for future participants.
