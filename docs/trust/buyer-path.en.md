# Enterprise Buyer Path (CFO / CISO / Compliance / CIO)

<span class="sovereignty-badge">Annual Procurement · Controlled Risk · Verifiable Evidence</span>

ATLANTYQA is purchased as **annual operating capacity** for regulated environments, not as a one-off project.

---

## What gets purchased

**AOA-EOM (12 months)**:

- **Annual base (OPEX)**: operations, hardening, monthly evidence, and quarterly SoC.
- **Capacity wallet**: traceable tasks and evidence packs.
- **Regulatory ad-hoc**: incidents, inspections, and regulatory changes under SLA.

## Stakeholder path

| Role | Core question | ATLANTYQA operating answer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CFO` | How do I control spend and ROI? | Consumption cap, quarterly KPIs, predictable annual cost. |
| `CISO` | How do I reduce risk without lock-in? | Local-first, SBOM/SCA, hardening, and contractual reversibility. |
| `Compliance` | How do I defend audits/inspections? | Monthly Evidence Pack + GitOps traceability + quarterly SoC. |
| `CIO` | How do I integrate without breaking core systems? | Modular lane rollout, incremental integration, and change control. |

## Expected outcomes

- Lower dependency on hour-based consulting.
- Reduced audit preparation lead time.
- Continuous evidence for committees and procurement.
- Vertical scaling without redesigning the procurement model.

## Recommended next step

1. Validate target vertical and regulatory framework.
2. Scope first lane (90-day activation inside Year 1).
3. Formalize annual AOA and quarterly steering cadence.
