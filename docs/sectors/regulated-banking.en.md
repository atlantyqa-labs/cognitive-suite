## Why It Matters

- **Regulatory standing**: Improved position with regulators and supervisors.
- **Cost reduction**: Lower compliance costs and legal exposure.
- **Control**: Automate without losing control.

## Vertical Operating Standard

### 1. Primary regulatory scope

- `DORA` (Regulation EU 2022/2554)
- `NIS2` (Directive EU 2022/2555)
- `GDPR` (Regulation EU 2016/679)
- `Solvency II` and EIOPA guidelines (insurance context)

### 2. What is purchased annually (AOA)

- **Annual base**: operations, hardening, monthly reporting, quarterly SoC.
- **Capacity wallet**: audit, incident, and third-party risk tasks.
- **Regulatory ad-hoc**: inspections, critical incidents, and regulatory changes.

### 3. Committee KPIs

| KPI | Operating target |
| :--- | :--- |
| Incident packs in `<24h` | Traceable regulatory response |
| Audit preparation lead time | Quarterly reduction |
| Third parties assessed coverage | Continuous increase |
| Evidence issued per month | Stable control cadence |

### 4. Sample evidence (anonymized)

- `evidence_pack_fin_qx.json`: control summary and status.
- `incident_pack_dora_anon.json`: timeline, impact, and measures.
- `third_party_risk_anon.csv`: ICT vendor scoring.

### 5. Declared limits

- Does not replace formal certification or external legal opinion.
- Does not replace internal control functions of the institution.
- Requires a client-defined data and access governance baseline.
