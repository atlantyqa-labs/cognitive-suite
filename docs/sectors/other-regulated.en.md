<div class="feature-card feature-card--accent-top-navy" markdown="1">
### 🛡️ Continuous Evidence
Generation of compliance proofs aligned with specific regulatory frameworks (NIS2, critical infrastructure, etc.).

### ⚙️ Legacy Integration
Ability to connect sovereign intelligence with existing operational systems (OT) and field assets.

## Why It Matters

<div class="tactical-container tactical-container--compact" markdown="1">

- **Risk Reduction**: Minimizes operational and regulatory exposure in environments where error is not an option.
- **Audit Acceleration**: Prepares the organization for external inspections with granular and accessible evidence.
- **Governance at Scale**: Standardizes data policy and security across complex and distributed infrastructures.

</div>

## Vertical Operating Standard

### 1. Primary regulatory scope

- `NIS2` for essential/important entities
- `ISA/IEC 62443` for OT/IACS environments
- `ISO 27001` and `ISO 22301` for security and continuity
- Sector-specific obligations (e.g., energy markets, transport, water)

### 2. What is purchased annually (AOA)

- **Annual base**: operational security posture, logging, and governance.
- **Capacity wallet**: incidents, OT changes, vendor risk, and reporting.
- **Regulatory ad-hoc**: operational crises, inspections, regulatory change requests.

### 3. Committee KPIs

| KPI | Operating target |
| :--- | :--- |
| Incident pack generation time | `<24h` for critical incidents |
| OT changes with complete evidence | Increasing monthly coverage |
| Critical third parties assessed | Controlled supply-chain risk |
| Audits with critical findings | Downward trend |

### 4. Sample evidence (anonymized)

- `ot_change_log_anon.json`: operational changes and validation.
- `incident_pack_ot_anon.json`: timeline, containment, recovery.
- `vendor_sbom_assessment_anon.csv`: dependency inventory and criticality.

### 5. Declared limits

- Does not replace external SOC services or sector CERT duties.
- Does not replace mandatory regulatory certifications.
- Requires client-defined segmentation architecture and operations model.
