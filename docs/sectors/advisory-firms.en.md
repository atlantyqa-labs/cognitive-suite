## Why It Matters

<div class="tactical-container tactical-container--compact" markdown="1">

- **Privilege Protection**: All intelligence remains on your infrastructure; nothing is sent to public clouds.
- **Deadline Efficiency**: Drastic reduction in time spent on repetitive tasks within each case folder.
- **Evidence by Design**: Generates compliance reports ready for submission to regulators or clients.

## Vertical Operating Standard

### 1. Primary regulatory scope

- `GDPR` (arts. 5, 30, 32, 33, and art. 9 when applicable)
- `LOPDGDD` (Spanish complementary framework)
- Tax/inspection framework (`AEAT`, `VeriFactu` where applicable)
- Anti-money laundering requirements (`AML`) in in-scope operations

### 2. What is purchased annually (AOA)

- **Annual base**: local-first environment, IAM, logging, backups, monthly reporting.
- **Capacity wallet**: validations, case evidence, scoring, and automation tasks.
- **Regulatory ad-hoc**: inspections, breaches, urgent regulatory requests, or litigation.

### 3. Committee KPIs

| KPI | Operating target |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cases with complete evidence | Increasing monthly coverage |
| Inspection preparation lead time | Quarterly reduction |
| Incidents documented in `<24h` | Controlled response |
| Reduced non-productive hours | Margin gain per team |

### 4. Sample evidence (anonymized)

- `case_anon_hashlog.json`: per-case document traceability.
- `inspection_pack_aeat_anon.pdf`: inspection-ready dossier.
- `breach_pack_anon.json`: event, impact, actions, closure.

### 5. Declared limits

- Does not replace legal opinion or an external DPO role.
- Does not replace specialized tax/accounting advisory.
- Requires document classification and access policies from the firm.
