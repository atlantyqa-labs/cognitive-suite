### 1. Primary regulatory scope

- `GDPR` (including art. 9 for health data)
- `LOPDGDD`
- `ENS` and `ENI` when public healthcare is in scope
- `ISO 27001/27701` for security and privacy (where applicable)

### 2. What is purchased annually (AOA)

- **Annual base**: access control, activity logging, and monthly evidence for DPO.
- **Capacity wallet**: clinical-access audit tasks, reporting, and control evaluations.
- **Regulatory ad-hoc**: breaches, inspections, and extraordinary requests.

### 3. Committee KPIs

| :--- | :--- |
| Clinical accesses with complete traceability | Continuous coverage |
| Privacy incident response time | `<24h` for critical cases |

### 4. Sample evidence (anonymized)

- `privacy_incident_pack_anon.json`: event, notification, closure.

### 5. Declared limits

- Does not replace legal advisory or the institution's DPO role.
- Requires client-defined identity and permission governance.
