## 2. ⚔️ Mission Execution

Follow the steps with surgical precision.

=== "Step 1: Ingest"
    Create a `confidential.txt` file in `data/input/` with fake (but realistic) data and execute it.

    ```bash
    python cogctl.py ingest confidential.txt
    ```

=== "Step 2: Armored Analysis"
    Activate the privacy shield. The `COGNITIVE_REDACT` variable is your best friend.

    ```bash
    # In PowerShell
    $env:COGNITIVE_REDACT="1"; python cogctl.py analyze

    # In Bash
    COGNITIVE_REDACT=1 python cogctl.py analyze
    ```

=== "Step 3: Verification"
    Check that the system worked. Open the resulting JSON.

    *   **Expected:** `"PERSON": "[REDACTED]"`
    *   **Failed:** `"PERSON": "Juan Pérez"`

### 🆘 Common Problems?

??? question "My document isn't processing"
    *   Is it in `data/input`?
    *   Does it have a `.txt` or `.pdf` extension?
    *   Do you have write permissions on `outputs/`?

??? question "I don't see redacted data"
    Make sure the environment variable is properly set. Do an `echo $env:COGNITIVE_REDACT` to check.
